Because the Arduino esp8266 upload tool failed to use and failed to upload after multiple attempts, the esp8266 network function was used to upload the file. Through the network, the browser opened the esp8266 upload page and uploaded it using the LittleFS file method;
No bugs were found in the function test;
Good luck!
